Clean iTunes Folder - v1.0.0

http://github.com/yrosen/cleanitunesfolder

This script will scan your iTunes library and your iTunes music folder,
and will list the files that appear in the folder but not in the library.

It's a good way to keep track of the files you THOUGHT you deleted but
are actually still hiding (and taking up space) on your hard drive.

This works on WINDOWS only, you'll need PHP for Windows or use the EXE.
The EXE was compiled with Bambalam - www.bambalam.se/bamcompile

TODO:
 - GUI in PHP-GTK?
 - Figure out how to disconnect from iTunes scripting interface

CHANGELOG:
v1.0.0 - June 21 2010
  * Original Release
